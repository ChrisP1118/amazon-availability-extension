# Amazon Availability

This Chrome extension displays availability and delivery date information while browsing items on Amazon.

During the COVID-19 crisis, Amazon extended stock and delivery times for items, often for weeks or months. When shopping, the list/filterable view of products doesn't
show the actual ship/delivery date -- you need to go to the page for a specific product to see when it might be available. There's no way to filter items based on how
soon they're available. This does the next best thing and adds the availability data to the list view. For products that you need soon, not weeks or months from now,
this can help you skip over products that won't be available for awhile.
